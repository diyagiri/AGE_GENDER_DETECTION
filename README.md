# AGE_GENDER_DETECTION
This project aims to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based age and gender detection AI system that can overcome these challenges and achieve high accuracy in diverse populations and visual conditions. 
Additionally, the project aims to address ethical concerns such as bias, privacy, and transparency, to ensure the system is both accurate and fair.
